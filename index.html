    <h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
    <h2>Moby Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular IT textbooks. But it's also good for making
        more traditional books such as the <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (Sometime written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and
        affectionately irreverent report on this classic American literature.</p>

    <h2>Moby Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank"><img src="images/moby_dick.png" alt="" /></a><br>
<em><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank">Moby-Dick</a></em> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:<br>
<blockquote>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</blockquote>
After driving off his spleene (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein approximately one jillion pages.
The only bigger than Moby Dick (who--<em>spolier alert!</em>--is a giant whale)is the book itself.</p>
